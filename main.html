    <h1 id="title">Chapter 4</h1>
    <p id="objects">Inside the time capsule, there were...<br>
        her journals, a chess piece, recipe from her mother, a news paper, a ring, and an old, black and white photo.
        <br><br>
    I wonder what all these meant to her. She always wrote something on those. Let's pick them up and take a closer look.

        <tr>
            <td><img id="book" title="pick up the journals." alt="Grandma kept her journal from a while back. This one is from her 20s... <br> 'I think I can finally see which trees are infested with fire ants... (hate them.) But we found a frog that seems to be not in the record. I'm sure it's a new species we have found. Everything seems good but I am extremely concerned that these people are cutting down too many trees in such a short amount of time. I'm hearing more and more cases of wild animals coming down to the villages. And if they keep cutting the trees down at this rate, there will be no amazon and wild life coming down to the villages won't be the only problem. Would like to release a hungry jaguar in that stupid &quot;board meeting&quot; ' " src="img/book.png" height="100vw"></td>
            <td><img id="doll" title="pick up the doll." alt="I thought I lost this! This was my favorite doll when I was a kid. I remember grandma asking me over and over again if I really want to put it in the time capsule. And I cried so much because I thought I lost it. I'm glad I found this. It will be part of my collection at home." src="img/chess piece.png" height="100vw"></td>
            <td><img id="recipe" title="pick up the recipe." alt="Could this be? YES! It's grandma's goulash recipe! Last time I had a goulash from a restaurant they didn't put caraway seeds. I was offened. Had my grandma was there, ooooh I can't even imagine the amount of rage she might have had. How can they call themselves Hungarian when they don't even put caraway seed in their goulash?" src="img/recipe.png" height="100vw"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><img id="paper" title="pick up the news paper." alt="Hey, this is the village news paper from when I was in 1st grade. Oh this is the article of me winning a flute competition when I was little. I looked cute! I didn't know she kept this paper like this? Maybe I should frame this and be like 'My glorious childhood (before I stopped playing flute).'" src="img/News paper.png" height="100vw"></td>
            <td><img id="ring" title="pick up the ring." alt="Grandma used to tell me that she will give me the ring when I grow up. She used to tell me how romantic granddad was, but all I learned from granddad was how to document frog specimen... <br>It has their initial inside, A&W. Anyways this ring... After all what happened, is it right for me to have it?" src="img/rign.png" height="100vw"></td>
            <td><img id="photo" title="pick up the old photo." alt="It's hard to tell who's in the picture but it looks like two people. Two young people I think... a man and a woman? In the back it says '03/19/1961 amazon, A, W.' <br>Aliz and William, are these grandma and granddad?! Amazon?! What were they even doing in Amazon?!" src="img/photo.png" height="100vw"></td>
