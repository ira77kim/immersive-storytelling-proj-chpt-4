    <h1 id="title">The time capsule</h1>
    <p id="objects">Inside the time capsule, there were...<br>
        her journals, your doll, recipe from her mother, a news paper, a ring, and an old, black and white photo.
        <br><br>
    You wonder what all these meant to her. You pick them up and take a closer look.

            <td><img id="book" title="pick up the journals." alt="Grandma kept her journal from a while back. This one is from her 20s. You open one of her journals and it says... <br> 'I think I can finally see which trees are infested with fire ants... (hate them.) But we found a frog that seems to be not in the record. I'm sure it's a new species we have found.' <br>You remember grandma's adventure storys she used to tell you as a bedtime story. Back then, she was your hero and you used to say, 'I want to be like grandma when I get older!'" src="img/book.png" height="100vw"></td>
            <td><img id="doll" title="pick up the doll." alt="You thought you lost this! This was your favorite doll when you were a kid. You remember grandma asking you over and over again if you really wanted to put it in the time capsule. And you cried so much because you thought you lost it. You're glad you found this. After all these years, it's still in a very nice condition as well. It could be part of your collection at home." src="img/chess piece1.png" height="100vw"></td>
            <td><img id="recipe" title="pick up the recipe." alt="'Could this be? YES! It's grandma's goulash recipe!' You used to love grandma's Goulash. But eversince your family stopped visiting her and grandma stopped visiting you, you never had this goulash again. You tried a bowl of goulash from a restaurant but they didn't taste right. Grandma must have thought that by the time we open this together, it would be time for her to share this recipe with me." src="img/recipe.png" height="100vw"></td>

            <td><img id="paper" title="pick up the news paper." alt="This is the village news paper from when you were in 1st grade. Oh this is the article of you winning a flute competition when you were little. You looked cute! You didn't know she kept this paper in this time capsule. Grandma must have kept this article as a souvenir. You are surprised at how the news paper is neatly folded and looks as if it is from yesterday." src="img/News paper.png" height="100vw"></td>
            <td><img id="ring" title="pick up the ring." alt="Grandma used to tell you that she will give you the ring when you grow up. She used to tell you how romantic granddad was, but all you learned from granddad was how to document frog specimen... <br>It has their initial inside, A&W. After all what happened, you are not sure if it is right for you to have the ring." src="img/rign.png" height="100vw"></td>
            <td><img id="photo" title="pick up the old photo." alt="It's hard to tell who's in the picture but it looks like two people. 'It looks like a young couple. The woman looks gorgeous in here.' In the back it says '03/19/1961 amazon.' <br>'This must be grandma and granddad when they were young.' You are surprised at how young and confident grandma looks in the photo and try to remember her face." src="img/photo.png" height="100vw"></td>
