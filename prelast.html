    <h1 id="title">Chapter 4</h1>
    <p id="objects">Inside the time capsule, there were...<br>
        her journals, a chess piece, recipe from her mother, a news paper, a ring, and an old, black and white photo.
        <br><br>
    I wonder what all these meant to her. She always wrote something on those. Let's pick them up and take a closer look.

            <td><img id="book" title="pick up the journals." alt="Grandma kept her journal from a while back. This one is from her 20s... <br> 'I think I can finally see which trees are infested with fire ants... (hate them.) But we found a frog that seems to be not in the record. I'm sure it's a new species we have found. Everything seems good but I am extremely concerned that these people are cutting down too many trees in such a short amount of time. I'm hearing more and more cases of wild animals coming down to the villages. And if they keep cutting the trees down at this rate, there will be no amazon and wild life coming down to the villages won't be the only problem. Would like to release a hungry jaguar in that stupid &quot;board meeting&quot; ' " src="img/book.png" height="100vw"></td>
            <td><img id="chess" title="pick up the chess piece." alt="It's a knight piece. in the bottom it says, 'first time I beat Martha. 11/02/1952' This must be from a chess game with great-aunt Martha. I still don't know who exactly won because they both say they won. Speaking of which, I never heard how this was settled since that's when the yelling started..." src="img/chess piece.png" height="100vw"></td>
            <td><img id="recipe" title="pick up the recipe." alt="Could this be? YES! It's grandma's goulash recipe! Last time I had a goulash from a restaurant they didn't put caraway seeds. I was offened. Had my grandma was there, ooooh I can't even imagine the amount of rage she might have had. How can they call themselves Hungarian when they don't even put caraway seed in their goulash?" src="img/recipe.png" height="100vw"></td>

            <td><img id="paper" title="pick up the news paper." alt="Aww this is a news paper from when dad was in high school. Ooooh, he won a math olympiad? He never told me that... But how did she keep this paper like this? Maybe I should frame this for grandma." src="img/News paper.png" height="100vw"></td>
            <td><img id="ring" title="pick up the ring." alt="Grandma used to tell me that she and granddad met in a forest. Apparently granddad taught her how to avoid fire ants. That actually sounds pretty useful. All I learned from granddad was how to document frog specimen... <br>Aww, it has their initial inside, A&W." src="img/rign.png" height="100vw"></td>
            <td><img id="photo" title="pick up the old photo." alt="It's hard to tell who's in the picture but it looks like two people. Two young people I think... a man and a woman? In the back it says '03/19/1961 amazon, A, W.' <br>Aliz and William, are these grandma and granddad?! Amazon?! What were they even doing in Amazon?!" src="img/photo.png" height="100vw"></td>
