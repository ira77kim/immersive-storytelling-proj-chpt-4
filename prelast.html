    <h1 id="title">The time capsule</h1>
    <p id="objects">Inside the time capsule, there were...<br>
        her journals, a chess piece, recipe from her mother, a news paper, a ring, and an old, black and white photo.
        <br><br>
    You wonder what all these meant to her. You pick them up and take a closer look.

This one is from her 20s... <br> 'I think I can finally see which trees are infested with fire ants... (hate them.) But we found a frog that seems to be not in the record. I'm sure it's a new species we have found. Everything seems good but I am extremely concerned that these people are cutting down too many trees in such a short amount of time. I'm hearing more and more cases of wild animals coming down to the villages. And if they keep cutting the trees down at this rate, there will be no amazon and wild life coming down to the villages won't be the only problem. Would like to release a hungry jaguar in that stupid &quot;board meeting&quot; ' " src="img/book.png" height="100vw"></td>
            <td><img id="doll" title="pick up the doll." alt="You thought you lost this! This was my favorite doll when you were a kid. You remember grandma asking you over and over again if you really wanted to put it in the time capsule. And you cried so much because you thought you lost it. You're glad you found this. It will be part of your collection at home." src="img/chess piece.png" height="100vw"></td>
            <td><img id="recipe" title="pick up the recipe." alt="Could this be? YES! It's grandma's goulash recipe! Last time you had a goulash from a restaurant they didn't put caraway seeds. You were offended. Had grandma was there, ooooh you can't even imagine the amount of rage she might have had. How can they call themselves Hungarian when they don't even put caraway seed in their goulash?" src="img/recipe.png" height="100vw"></td>

Oh this is the article of you winning a flute competition when you were little. You looked cute! You didn't know she kept this paper like this. Maybe you should frame this and be like 'My glorious childhood (before I stopped playing flute).'" src="img/News paper.png" height="100vw"></td>
            <td><img id="ring" title="pick up the ring." alt="Grandma used to tell you that she will give you the ring when you grow up. She used to tell you how romantic granddad was, but all you learned from granddad was how to document frog specimen... <br>It has their initial inside, A&W. Anyways this ring... After all what happened, is it right for you to have it?" src="img/rign.png" height="100vw"></td>
            <td><img id="photo" title="pick up the old photo." alt="It's hard to tell who's in the picture but it looks like two people. Two young people you think... a man and a woman? In the back it says '03/19/1961 amazon, A, W.' <br>Aliz and William, are these grandma and granddad?! Amazon?! What were they even doing in Amazon?!" src="img/photo.png" height="100vw"></td>
